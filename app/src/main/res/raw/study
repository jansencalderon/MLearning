In neutralization reactions it is defined as that weight of a substance in rams which (1) contains, (2) furnishes, (3) reacts with directly or indirectly, or (4) replaces 1 gram-atom or ion of hydrogen. Gram-milliequivalent weight (GmEW) is defined as GEW/1000. This term is used quite frequently in titrimetric calculations. The term equivalent (equiv) is defined as the number of gram-equivalents involved in a quantitative procedure. The term milliequivalent (meq)is used more frequently and is defined as the number of gram-milliequivalents involved in a quantitative procedure. (A useful analogy to help distinguish between equivalents and gram-equivalent weight is a bag containing identical marbles. The number of marbles in the bag is analogous to the number of gram-equivalents of chemical in solution, and the weight of a single marble is analogous to the gram-equivalent weight of the chemical.) A standard solution is a solution of known normality or molarity. Normality  is a concentration expression and is defined as the number of equivalents of solute per liter (equiv/liter) or milliequivalents per milliliter (meq/ml) of solution. Molarity is an expressions of the concentration of a solution in terms of moles per liter. The determination of the normality or molarity of a solution is known as standardization. This may be accomplished by the use of another standard solution known as a secondary standard, or by the use of a carefully weighed sample of a substance of known purity which is termed a primary standard. Thus a solution of hydrochloric acid may be standardized titrimetrically using a standard solution of sodium hydroxide as a secondary standard or using a sample of sodium carbonate of known purity as a primary standard.",

                "body": "aqueous\r\n\r\nAn aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na+(aq) + Cl−(aq). The word aqueous means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.\r\nSubstances that are hydrophobic ('water-fearing') often do not dissolve well in water, whereas those that are hydrophilic ('water-loving') do. An example of a hydrophilic substance is sodium chloride. Acids and bases are aqueous solutions, as part of their Arrhenius definitions.\r\nThe ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether the substance can match or exceed the strong attractive forces that water molecules generate between themselves. If the substance lacks the ability to dissolve in water the molecules form a precipitate.\r\nReactions in aqueous solutions are usually metathesis reactions. Metathesis reactions are another term for double-displacement; that is, when a cation displaces to form an ionic bond with the other anion. The cation bonded with the latter anion will dissociate and bond with the other anion.\r\nAqueous solutions that conduct electric current efficiently contain strong electrolytes, while ones that conduct poorly are considered to have weak electrolytes. Those strong electrolytes are substances that are completely ionized in water, whereas the weak electrolytes exhibit only a small degree of ionization in water.\r\nNonelectrolytes are substances that dissolve in water yet maintain their molecular integrity (do not dissociate into ions). Examples include sugar, urea, glycerol, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM).\r\nWhen writing the equations of aqueous reactions, it is essential to determine the precipitate. To determine the precipitate, one must consult a chart of solubility. Soluble compounds are aqueous, while insoluble compounds are the precipitate. Remember that there may not always be a precipitate.\r\nWhen performing calculations regarding the reacting of one or more aqueous solutions, in general one must know the concentration, or molarity, of the aqueous solutions. Solution concentration is given in terms of the form of the solute prior to it dissolving.",

These assays sometimes take some perfecting in terms of being able to judge the endpoint precisely.\r\nFor obvious reasons Karl Fischer titration for water content is nonaqueous, usually done in methanol or sometimes inethanol.",

The reactions which occur during many nonaqueous titrations can be explained by means of the concepts of the Brønsted-Lowry theory. According to this theory an acid is a proton donor, i.e. a substance which tends to dissociate to yield a proton, and a base is proton acceptor, i.e. a substance which tends to combine with a proton. When an acid HB dissociates it yields a proton together with the conjugate base B of the acid:",

In such a procedure, the basic sample is treated with an amount of standard acid known to be in excess of a chemically equivalent amount, and the excess acid is subsequently titrated with a standard base. The amount of standard acid which is chemically equivalent to the basic sample can be calculated simply by subtracting, from the total amount of standard acid employed, the amount of acid neutralized by the standard base in the back titration.",

This is evidenced by the 2007 pet food incident and the 2008 Chinese milk powder scandal, when melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical, was added to raw materials to fake high protein contents. Also, different correction factors are needed for different proteins to account for different amino acid sequences.

The medium should be acidic to avoid the formation of  Fe(OH)3 \r\nHowever, the use of acidic medium together with added SCN- titrant increase the solubility of the precipitate leading to significant errors.  This problem had been overcome by two main procedures.",

Both of these are more expensive and time consuming.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is not a strong reaction between EBT and the metal. This can be overcome by a displacement titration. The solution begins with the Mg2+ complexed with EDTA. The analyte is added (assuming higher binding constant and lower concentration) and the Mg2+ is displaced. The Mg2+ is titrated with EBT.\r\nA second way to overcome titrations with weak end points is to do a back titration. In a back titration, excess EDTA is added to the sample solution. The excess is then titrated with a standard Mg or Zn solution \r\nEDTA is a widely applicable complexing agent as it will complex with almost any metal.

                "body": "Balancing Redox Reactions\r\nBalancing redox reactions is slightly more complex than balancing standard reactions, but still follows a relatively simple set of rules. One major difference is the necessity to know the half-reactions of the involved reactants; a half-reaction table is very useful for this.  Half-reactions are often useful in that two half reactions can be added to get a total net equation. Although the half-reactions must be known to complete a redox reaction, it is often possible to figure them out without having to use a half-reaction table. This is demonstrated in the acidic and basic solution examples. Besides the general rules for neutral conditions, additional rules must be applied for aqueous reactions in acidic or basic conditions.\r\nThe method used to balance redox reactions is called the Half Equation Method. In this method, the equation is separated into two half-equations; one for oxidation and one for reduction.\r\nEach equation is balanced by adjusting coefficients and adding H2O, H+, and e- in this order:\r\n1.\tBalance elements in the equation other than O and H.\r\n2.\tBalance the oxygen atoms by adding the appropriate number of water (H2O) molecules to the opposite side of the equation.\r\n3.\tBalance the hydrogen atoms (including those added in step 2 to balance the oxygen atom) by adding H+ ions to the opposite side of the equation.               \r\n4.\tAdd up the charges on each side. Make them equal by adding enough electrons (e-) to the more positive side. (Rule of thumb: e- and H+ are almost always on the same side.)\r\n5.\tThe e- on each side must be made equal; if they are not equal, they must be multiplied by appropriate integers (the lowest common multiple) to be made the same.\r\n6.\tThe half-equations are added together, canceling out the electrons to form one balanced equation. Common terms should also be canceled out.\r\n7.\t(If the equation is being balanced in a basic solution, through the addition of one more step, the appropriate number of OH- must be added to turn the remaining H+ into water molecules.)\r\n8.\tThe equation can now be checked to make sure that it is balanced.",

                "body": "Balancing Redox Reactions\r\nOxidation-Reduction Reactions, or redox reactions, are reactions in which one reactant is oxidized and one reactant is reduced simultaneously. This module demonstrates how to balance various redox equations.\r\nIdentifying Redox Reactions\r\nThe first step in balancing any redox reaction is determining whether or not it is even an oxidation-reduction reaction, which requires that species exhibits changing oxidation states during the reaction. To maintain charge neutrality in the sample, the redox reaction will entail both a reduction component and an oxidation component and is often separated into independent two hypothetical half-reactions to aid in understanding the reaction. This requires identifying which element is oxidized and which element is reduced. For example, consider this reaction:\r\nCu(s)+2Ag+(aq)→Cu2+(aq)+2Ag(s)(1)(1)Cu(s)+2Ag+(aq)→Cu2+(aq)+2Ag(s)\r\nThe first step in determining whether the reaction is a redox reaction is to splitting the equation into two hypothetical half-reactions. Let's start with the half-reaction involving the copper atoms:\r\nCu(s)→Cu2+(aq)(2a)(2a)Cu(s)→Cu2+(aq)\r\nThe oxidation state of copper on the left side is 0 because it is an element on its own. The oxidation state of copper on the right hand side of the equation is +2. The copper in this half-reaction is oxidized as the oxidation states increases from 0 in Cu to +2 in Cu2+. Now consider the silver atoms\r\n2Ag+(aq)→2Ag(s)(2b)(2b)2Ag+(aq)→2Ag(s)\r\nIn this half-reaction, the oxidation state of silver on the left side is a +1. The oxidation state of silver on the right is 0 because it is an element on its own. Because the oxidation state of silver decreases from +1 to 0, this is the reduction half-reaction.\r\nConsequently, this reaction is a redox reaction as both reduction and oxidation half-reactions occur (via the transfer of electrons that are not explicitly shown in equations 2). Once confirmed, it often necessary to balance the reaction (the reaction in equation 1 is balanced already though), which can be accomplished in two ways because the reaction could take place in neutral, acidic or basic conditions.",

It usually represents the inorganic salts naturally occurring in the drug and adhering to it, but it may also include inorganic matter added for the purposes of adulteration. There is considerable difference in the ash content of different drugs, but the difference varies within narrow limits in the case of the same individual drug; hence, an ash determination furnishes a basis for judging the identity and cleanliness of a drug and gives information relative to its adulteration with inorganic matter. Ash standards have been established for a number of the official drugs; usually these standards set a maximum limit on the total ash or on the acid-insoluble ash permitted. The total ash is the residue remaining after incineration; the acid-insoluble ash is the part of the total ash which is insoluble in diluted hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe ash or residue yielded by an organic chemical compound is, as a rule, a measure of the amount of inorganic matter present as impurity. In most cases, the organic matter is present in small amounts which are difficult to remove in the purification process and which are not objectionable if only traces are present.\r\nThe careful control of temperature is the most important analytical factor to regulate in making ash determinations. All determinations should be made in such a manner as to duplicate insofar as possible the conditions under which standards are established.",

When crude drugs, for example, are sold with guaranteed assay for active constituents, the percent active constituents must be calculated on the basis of the moisture-free drug.

In cases where this is the object sought, it is important that a solvent be used which will not dissolve appreciable quantities of substances other than those sought in the extraction. In some cases, the amount of a drug soluble in a given solvent is an index of its purity; acacia must yield not more than 1% water-insoluble residue to meet the official requirement.\r\n             For efficient and complete extraction, the solvent should be divided into a number of relatively small portions and used successively. Each portion should be brought into intimate contact with all parts of the sample and then be removed before addition of the next portion. The use of fresh portions of solvent not saturated with extractive favors the rapid and thorough removal of the solute with the minimum quantity of solvent.\r\n            The complete removal of extractive matter from a drug by this method, however, requires a large quantity to solvent in most cases, and most volatile solvents are expensive. Consequently, it is convenient and economical to be able to use the same portion of solvent repeatedly. To do so necessitates the separation of the solvent and solute after the extraction, the separated solvent being employed in a second extraction apparatus, of which the Soxhlet is a good example.\r\n           The Soxhlet is the apparatus generally used for extraction with volatile solvents where small quantities of a drug are extracted, as in quantitative work. The solvent is placed in a weighed flask A, which is heated over an\r\n \r\n electric hot plate or over a water bath in the absence of a gas flame when the solvent is highly inflammable. The weighed sample of drug is placed in a porous paper extraction thimble which is the fitted into the extraction tube B. \r\nA reflux condenser C is attached to the top of the extraction tube. The solvent vapors pass upward from the flask A and through the side tube D of the extractor to the condenser. The condensate drips into the thimble until a sufficient amount has accumulated to raise level of liquid in the extraction tube to the top of the siphon tube E. the solution that has been standing in contact with the drug is then discharged into the flask where the solvent is vaporized again. The solvent passes through this cycle repeatedly, and the solute is collected in the flask. The heat should be adjusted so that the solvent passes through the cycle about once every 10 min. the top of the thimble should be above the level of the top of the siphon side tube. The solvent must not be volatilized more rapidly than it will filter through the porous thimble, or the latter will overflow and carry insoluble matter over mechanically. After the extraction is complete, the flask is removed, the solvent is driven off until the flask and its contents are of constant weight, and the percentage of extractive in the drug is calculated from the weight of the residue.",
